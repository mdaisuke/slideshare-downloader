this is just working script for my env and what I want.
so no there's no guarantee to work well in others's environment
## run script
```
# setup install selenium + chromdriver in some way
bundle install -j4

bundle ex ruby app.rb <slideshare-url>

# you can find slideshare.pdf in the same directory

rm *.jpg # cleanup
```
